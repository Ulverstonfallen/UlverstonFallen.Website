    <h2>
        <a name="javaScript"></a>
        Java script
    </h2>

    <p>
        This website uses Java Script (a programming language) to improve site functionality. You might not have heard of it, but don’t worry,
        most people haven’t.
    </p>

    <p>
        Virtually all modern websites use Java Script in one way or another. Some are impossible to use if it is disabled. Most will still be
        usable, but with reduced functionality. The approach of this site is to allow you to still view details of the fallen, if it’s disabled.
        However, you will not be able to filter the list of fallen on the detail page or use the main mapping page, both are heavily dependent
        on Java Script.
    </p>

    <p>
        If Java Script has not been disabled on the browser you are using, all site functionality is available to you.
    </p>

    <p>
        OR
    </p>

    <p>
        If Java Script has been disabled on the browser you are using, the site will have reduced functionality. This is probably because you are
        aware of Java Script and have chosen to disable it. In order to get full functionality, you need to enable Java Script for this site.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you haven’t disabled it or know nothing about it, then someone who uses your computer has almost certainly disabled it. In order to
        get full functionality, you need to get that person to enable it for this, or even all websites.
