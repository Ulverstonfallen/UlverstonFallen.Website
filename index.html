        Ulverston Fallen: World War I began as a remembrance project during the centenary year of the end of the Great War of 1914 – 1918
        in preparation for GP90, the recreation by <a href="https://www.britishlegion.org.uk" target="_blank">The Royal British Legion</a>
        in August 2018 of the Great Pilgrimage of 1928.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project aimed to ensure that the 175 men and women who are named on the Ulverston war memorial were not merely recorded as names cast
        in bronze on plaques attached to the memorial in Market Square but were commemorated as Ulverstonians; real people, loved and mourned by
        family and friends, and remembered with the deepest respect, admiration and thanks.
    </p>

    <p>
        The information collated during this research project has been made available on this website as an open access resource in memory of
        the fallen. Additional contributions will be gratefully received and uploaded to supplement the database and enrich the information
        available on the life stories and histories of the Ulverston Fallen of the Great War.
