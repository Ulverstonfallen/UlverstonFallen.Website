    <p class="det-info">Albert enlisted into the 4th Battalion of the King's Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment) on 19 November 1915 in Broughton-in-Furness. 
                            Albert's army medical record states that he was 27 years old when he enlisted but this doesn't match his census records or 
                            the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) record of his death at 25.</p>
